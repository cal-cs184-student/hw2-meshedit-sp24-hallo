<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this homework assignment, Mesh Edit, we implemented the following: Bezier curves, Bezier surfaces, Phong shading, edge flip, edge split, and loop subdivision. Bezier curves were calculated using a recursive convex combination of control points. Bezier surfaces are an extension of Bezier curves; our implementation calculated Bezier curves along each dimension, which then resulted in a point on the Bezier surface. Phong shading is found by utilizing area-weighted vertex normals. Then, we implemented edge flip and edge split, which mainly consisted of reassigning pointers for the relevant objects and creating new objects and setting their pointers (for edge split). Finally, we implemented loop subdivision, which utilizes both edge flipping and edge splitting. All of this allowed us to not only see interactive visualizations of how Bezier curves are created but also directly edit and render 3D meshes in real time.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau's algorithm is used to create Bezier curves, which can be constructed using Berstein polynomials. In essence, we start with n control points and recursively subdivide until we have one point remaining. One iteration of a subdivision is taking a convex combination of two consecutive points, parameterized by t (where t is between 0 and 1, inclusive). In our implementation, we wrote a function called evaluateStep that does one recursive step. Then, we have a function called evaluate that calls evaluateStep, iteratively calculating the next level’s control points rather than recursive.
</p>

  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    The de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by evaluating the Bernstein polynomials along each dimension. For example, let’s say we have dimensions u and v. Then, we first take our 2D surface that becomes our control points, and interpolate along dimension u. Then we get a “moving” Bezier curve that is along dimension v. Finally, we evaluate this moving curve along dimension v to get our final point that’ll be on the Bezier surface.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented the area-weighted vertex normals by iterating about a central vertex (which I refer to as the current vertex). We use two properties of the cross product of two vectors: (1) the cross product is orthogonal via the right hand rule and (2) its norm is the area of parallelogram of the two vectors used for the cross product. Using this fact, an area-weighted surface normal for a triangle is half of the cross product of two of its edges. In our implementation, we called the two edges (vectors) v1 and v2, where v1 is the edge between h->twin()->next()->next()->vertex() and our current vertex; v2 is the edge between h->twin()->vertex() and our current vertex. Then, the area-weighted vertex normal is the normalized vector of the sum of the area-weighted surface normals.

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    Implementing edge flip was (very bashy oml) mainly re-assigning pointers to the objects that already existed. First, we listed all of the elements including the half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces. Then, we re-assigned the relevant pointers: vertices’ halfedges, edge’s halfedges, faces’ halfedges, and halfedges’ neighbors. We drew out all the relevant objects as follows and implemented it.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    Just like edge flip, we listed all of the existing elements available including the edges, the halfedges, vertices, faces and so on (for example, refer to the diagram below, halfedges h0,h1,…,h5, vertices a,b,c,d, edges e1, e2, e3, e5 and faces f0, f1).
    Then, we created a new vertex labeled midpoint, m, by finding the average position between the vertices a,b of the edge. 3 new edges, 6 new halfedges and 2 new faces are then created. The faces are then assigned to a corresponding halfedges.  The edges are also assigned to halfedges. Finally, we use setNeighbours to reassign all halfedges to the correct next halfedge, twin, vertex, edge and face. Note that h0, the original edge and corresponding halfedges were reassigned to correspond to the split edge.
    For debugging, we drew out the diagram to visualize the edge split. A trick we used was instead of using numbers to label the halfedges (e.g. h10, h15), we tried labeling the halfedges by the letters of the edge it corresponds to in the diagram (e.g. hmc, ham. hma).

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
    <br>
<p>
    Our implementation is
</p>
    <p>
        Step 1: We computed the new positions for all the original vertices in the input mesh. We looped through all the existing vertices, setting isNew to false for all of them. Then according to the loop subdivision rule below, we found n and calculated u. Given the equation newPosition of old vertex = (1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum, we also found the sum of the original neighboring vertices by using a while loop, setting h=h->twin()->next() until it returns to the original h. All of the new positions found were stored in each vertex’s newPosition.
    </p>
    <div align="middle">
        <img src="images/loopSubEqn.png" align="middle" width="70%">
    </div>
    <p>
        Step 2: We iterated through all the edges and set isNew to false.
        We then updated the position of the new vertex on the edge (A,B) using the equation
    </p>
    <p> new vertex Position = 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)
        (refer to diagram on the right above).
    </p>
    <p>Step 3: We split every old edge in the mesh, by iterating through the edges, identifying whether the edge is from the original mesh and calling splitEdge(e).
    </p>
    <p> Step 4: we flipped only new edges connecting old and new vertices.</p>
    <p>
        Step 5: we looped through all the vertices and copied the new vertex positions into the final vertex position.
    </p>
    <p>
        For debugging, we initially had problems where we’d label old edges that had been split as isNew=true, causing them to be flipped as well. By drawing the diagram below, we identified the problem. In step 3, we initially used isNew to identify if the edge is from the original mesh, but the 2 edges from splitting the original edge were always identified as old and continued to be split, resulting in an infinite loop. We solved this by checking if both vertices of an edge are old (isNew=false) instead.
    </p>

<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
    <br>
<p>
    After loop subdivision, the mesh becomes more uniform and smooth. The sharp corners and edges are averaged and smoothed out. For example in the torus the sharp corners are smoothed out causing it to become a smooth ring shape. However, we can see that in the case of the cube, the shape becomes increasingly asymmetric since the original mesh had an asymmetric number of edges for the vertices. We can reduce the effect of smoothing out corners by adding more edges around the sharp corners. For example, splitting the edges in the diagonals of the cube surfaces lead to a more uniform subdivision,
    causing it to have a relatively more spherical shape.</p>
